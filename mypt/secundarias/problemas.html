        <h1> <b>Problemas del 2021</b></h1>
        <h3> <b> 1. Invent Yourself</b></h3>
        <p>Design  a  boat  that  moves  only  due  to  the  periodical mechanical movements of its internal parts and which only interacts with the environment (air, water) through its stiff hull.  Optimise  the  parameters  of  your  boat  for  maximum speed.</p>

        <h3> <b> 2. Circling Magnets</b></h3>
        <p> Button  magnets  with  different  diameters  are  attached  to each  end  of  a  cylindrical  battery.  When  placed  on  an aluminium  foil  the  object  starts  to  circle.  Investigate  how the motion depends on relevant parameters.
</p>

        <h3> <b> 3. Proximity Sensor</b></h3>
        <p> A simple    passive    inductive    sensor    can    detect ferromagnetic  objects  moving  through  its  magnetic  field. Construct   such   a   passive   sensor  and   investigate   its characteristics such as sensing range.</p>

        <h3> <b> 4. Wind Speed</b></h3>
        <p> Let  an  electric  current  flow  through  a  coil.  When  cold  air flows over the coil, the coil’s temperature will decrease. Investigate how the temperature drop depends on the wind speed. What is the accuracy of this method of measuring the wind speed?</p>

        <h3> <b> 5. Synchronised Candles</b></h3>
        <p>Oscillatory flames can be observed when several candles burn next to each other. Two such oscillators can couple with   each   other,   resulting   in   in-phase   or   anti-phase synchronisation  (depending  on  the  distance  between  the sets  wvof candles). Explain and investigate this phenomenon.</p>

        <h3> <b> 6. Irreversible Cartesian Diver</b></h3>
        <p> A simple Cartesian diver (e.g. an inverted test tube partially filled with water) is placed in a long vertical tube filled with water.  Increasing  the  pressure  in  the  tube  forces  the Cartesian diver to sink. When it reaches acertain depth, it never  returns  to  the  surface  even  if  the  pressure  is changed   back   to   its   initial   value.   Investigate   this phenomenon and how it depends on relevant parameters.</p>

        <h3> <b> 7. Bead Dynamics</b></h3>
        <p> A   circular   hoop   rotates   about   a vertical  diameter.  A  small  bead  is allowed  to  roll  in  a  groove  on  the inside  of  the  hoop.  Investigate  the relevant  parameters  affecting  the dynamics of the bead.</p>

        <h3> <b> 9. Light Whiskers</b></h3>
        <p>When a laser beam enters a soap film at a small angle, a rapidly changing pattern of thin, branching light tracks may appear   inside   the   film.   Explain   and   investigate   this phenomenon.</p>

        <h3> <b> 10. Spin Drift </b></h3>
        <p> When  a  ring  is  set to  roll  in  a  parabolic  bowl,  interesting motion patterns may arise. Investigate this phenomenon.</p>

        <h3> <b> 11. Guitar String </b></h3>
        <p> A periodic force is applied to a steel guitar string using an electromagnet.  Investigate  the  motion  of  the  guitar  string around its resonancefrequency.</p>

        <h3> <b> 12. Wilberforce Pendulum</b></h3>
        <p> A Wilberforce pendulum consists of a mass hanging from a  vertically  oriented  helical  spring.  The  mass  can  both move  up  and  down  on  the  spring  and  rotate  about  its vertical axis. Investigate the behaviour of such a pendulum and how it depends on relevant parameters.</p>

        <h3> <b> 13. Sponge</b></h3>
        <p> A  sponge  will  soak  up  water  at  a  rate  and  in  a  quantity determined   by   various   parameters.   Investigate   how effective a sponge is at drying a wet surface.</p>

        <h3> <b> 14. Dynamic Hydrophobicity</b></h3>
        <p> When  a  drop  of  liquid  impacts  on  a  horizontally  moving surface, the droplet may be reflected or not, depending on the   speed   of   the   surface.   Investigate   the   interaction between a moving surface and a liquid drop.</p>

        <h3> <b> 15. Rebounding Capsule</b></h3>
        <p> A  spherical  ball  dropped  onto  a  hard  surface  will  never rebound to the release height, even if it has an initial spin. A  capsule-shaped  object  (i.e.  Tic  Tac  mint)  on  the  other hand   may   exceed   the   initial   height.   Investigate   this phenomenon.</p>

        <h3> <b> 16. Ultrasonic Pump</b></h3>
        <p > A  capillary  immersed  in  an  ultrasonic  bath  works  like  a pump that can lift water to a considerable height. Explain and investigate this phenomenon.</p>

        <h3> <b> 17. Hand Helicopter</b></h3>
        <p >A simple hand helicopter can be made by attaching rotor blades to one end of a vertical stick. The helicopter moves upwards when the stick is twisted at a high enough speed and  then  let  go.  Investigate how  the  relevant  parameters affect the lift-off and the maximum height.</p>

        <h3><b>14. Falling Tower</b></h3>
        <p>Identical discs are stacked one on top of another to form a freestanding tower.

        <h3><b>16. Nitinol Engine</b></h3>
        <p>Place a nitinol wire loop around two pulleys with their axes located at some distance from each other. If one of the pulleys is immersed into hot water, the wire tends to straighten, causing a rotation of the pulleys. Investigate the properties of such an engine.</p>
